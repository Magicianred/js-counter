## Description

This is my second project for <span style="text-decoration: underline">[Start2Impact.it](https://www.start2impact.it/)</span> in its *__Full Stack Development__* path.
It's a simple counter built using: 

* HTML
* Javascript 
* CSS and Bootstrap 5

The buttons are handled through "click" Event Listeners that interact with the counter value and modify it based on the user's action.
